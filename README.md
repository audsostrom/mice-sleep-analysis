Undergraduate Sleep Mice Analysis Project at UCSC.


## TODO:

### To further develop our models
[ ] parse .dat for faster data parsing
[ ] make all models "modular" python files, so they can be run from the master model testing script
[ ] Test models with more data for a more versatile model
[Adam] Create model running script that lets us select models and data
[ ] Making input parser artifacting parameter based rather than "any overlap = artifact"

### For usability as a research tool
[ ] Comment yer code 
[] Create output modification to 1-make artifact always correct, and 2- artifact "Close Calls" by some sort of parameter to inflate accuracy
[ ] Make model running scruipt user-friendly for neuro ppl
[ ] Make model spit out an annotated output so it's usable for the Researchers

### For quality as a portfolio Project
[ ] Document Document Document
[ ] Remove unused code, refactor garbage out
