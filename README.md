Undergraduate Sleep Mice Analysis Project at UCSC.


## TODO:

### To further develop our models
- parse .dat for faster data parsing
- make all models "modular" python files, so they can be run from the master model testing script
-Test models with more data for a more versatile model
- Create model running script that lets us select models and data

### For usability as a research tool
- Make model running scruipt user-friendly for neuroscientists
- Make model spit out an annotated output so it's usable for the researchers
